# Lesson Exercise Generation Progress Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of creating exercises for all lessons in the Madrasti platform.

**Total Lessons**: 2001
**Lessons with Exercises**: 75
**Lessons Remaining**: 1926

## Generation Strategy
We will process lessons in batches of 10, prioritizing by:
1.  **Higher grade levels first** (Terminal Class → First Year Primary)
2.  **Core subjects** (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
3.  **Lesson ID order** within each batch
